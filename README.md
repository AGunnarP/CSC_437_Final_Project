There is a /dashboard I intend admin accounts to directly navigate to from the browser. The content for it will not load unless you are in the admin account. 

The admin account is:
Username: admin
Password: 1ce$ucks 

This is a vps that serves backend calls to my webapp on a wordpress site. 

The .env file in the backend has the information for connecting to a mongodb database.

This is a vite+react node project.
